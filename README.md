# spotify-like-notifier
a simple shell script to learn if someone liked one of your spotify playlists. this is for those who have tons of spotify playlists and want to know which of their playlists are in fashion.

## usage
on terminal, go to the directory of main.sh, and run this:

```
sh main.sh YOUR_SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

if a like count of a playlist has been changed since the last execution of the script, it will print the playlist name with the playlist's previous and current like counts.
